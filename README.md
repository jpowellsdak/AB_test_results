# AB_test_results
AB test results project for Udacity Data Analysis nanodegree.

    * For this project, I had to analyse the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help the company 
    understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Installation

  This project consists of a jupyter notebook,1 data files, and an html report with findings.

    * Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb
    * ab_data.csv
    * Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html

Download the files to a directory

## Usage

    * Run the Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb from within jupyter. 
    * The report (Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.html) can be viewed from a browser to see the results without having to run the notebook.
